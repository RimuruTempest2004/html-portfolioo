  Rimuru is an eccentric and childish person by nature but this shouldn't be mistaken for immaturity and naivety.
  Underneath the surface, Rimuru is constantly analyzing, planning, and weighing the pros and cons of their actions, 
  taking the smart move in the long term over more rash and emotional decisions. In betrayal of this composed and calculative demeanor, 
  Rimuru is ruthless when it comes to handling people who have aroused genuine fury inside of them. They'll go as far as acts of brutal 
  torture and murder without so much as batting an eye if it can be gotten away with, and they use more subtle methods like intimidation 
  and blackmail when those cards are off the table.

<p>Rimuru also takes a great deal of care with their personal image, lying on official accounts,[3][4] erasing memories,
  [5] and creating forged historical documents to make them appear as a more kind and benevolent person than they are in reality.
  [6] Despite Rimuru's often selfish and nefarious tendencies, they do deeply care for their subordinates, viewing them as something like a 
  family or collection of children. And due to the memories of Satoru Mikami and Shizu, Rimuru has access to a robust set of human ethics to 
  rely on when their more cruel monster self isn't up to the task.

  Rimuru's goal in life is to create a convenient world where they can kick back and lazily enjoy entertainment similar in quality to what is found on Earth.
